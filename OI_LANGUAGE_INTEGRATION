		After responding with initialized all requests must be terminated with:
			end-of-conversation

		// Indentation is only to show hierarchy not required in output
		// Arguments in [] are optional
		//	typesearch => Is searchable under typesearch
		//	filesearch => Is searchable under file browse list

	PARAMETER:
		signature-from-position PATH_TO_FILE|LINE|COLUMN
	
	RESPONSE FORMAT (fixed lines):

		// the reference under the position passed to it
		// If not found return nothing

		REFERENCE_START_LINE|REFERENCE_START_COLUMN
		REFERENCE_END_LINE|REFERENCE_END_COLUMN

Go to definition
	PARAMETER:
		go-to-definition PATH_TO_FILE|LINE|COLUMN

	RESPONSE FORMAT
		Whatever specified in command definitions. Hopefully something like editor goto

Retrieve members from signature
	PARAMETER:
		members-from-signature SIGNATURE
